# How to:

Start the game and then start the program.

All versions of PCSX2 should be supported. I have tested with the following versions:

* PCSX2 1.4 (32bit)
* PCSX2 1.6 (32 bit)
* PCSX2 2.3 (64 bit)

The following NTSC versions of the game are supported:

**SOCOM 1**
* Black Label Disk 1 (CRC 6F4056DB)
* Black Label Disk 4 (CRC 6F4056DB)
* Blac Label Disk 8 (CRC 1349C549)
* Black Label Disk 10 (CRC B1C47426)
* Red Label Disk 10 (CRC B1C47426)
* Red Label Disk 11 (CRC B1C47426)

**SOCOM 2**
* Red Label Disk 2 (CRC 0F6FC6CF)
* Black Label Disk 3 (CRC 0F6FC6CF)

> When it comes to SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault the CRC is based on the ISO's CRC, pcsx2's console window might report a different CRC if you have the patch installed.

**SOCOM 3**
* CRC 75ED4282

**SOCOM Combined Assault**
* CRC D7CFDCCF

If you have a NTSC version of any of the games that is not listed here and the program does not work please open an issue here.
